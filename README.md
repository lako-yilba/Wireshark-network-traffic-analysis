# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how network traffic can be analyzed using Wireshark.
It focuses on understanding basic network communication by examining packet-level
data from captured network traffic.

## Protocols Covered
- ICMP
- TCP
- HTTP

## Tool Used
- Wireshark

## Data Source
The PCAP files used in this project were provided as part of a structured
cybersecurity training lab for hands-on learning.

## Project Structure
- The analysis folder contains detailed protocol analysis files.
- The screenshots folder contains images taken during traffic analysis.
- Each analysis file documents observations and security relevance.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a strong foundation in network traffic
analysis and gain practical experience useful for entry-level cybersecurity roles.
